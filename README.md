Vulkan project from scratch to review the API

    TODO:
      Models  
      Textures  
      Shaders ( descriptor sets, render pass, etc)  
      Multithreading to practice submitting command buffers to a main thread for queue submission

"Recording commands in Vulkan is relatively cheap. Most of the work goes into the vkQueueSubmit call, where the commands are validated in the driver and translated into real GPU commands."
